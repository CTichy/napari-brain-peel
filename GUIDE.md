## 1. What this plugin does

You have a confocal microscopy stack of a zebrafish brain. The image contains the brain you care about plus skin, tissue, and background surrounding it.

This plugin does two things, in order:

**Step A — Skin Removal (Tab 1):** Uses a trained AI model (MONAI 3D U-Net) to automatically detect and remove everything outside the brain, producing a clean `brain_only` image where only the cells of interest remain visible.

**Step B — Label (Tab 2):** From the cleaned image, automatically finds and labels each individual cell as a separately numbered 3D region. Lets you sort, split, and edit labels before saving.

**Step C — Analyse (Tab 3):** Computes a comprehensive set of shape statistics for each labelled cell and exports them to a CSV file, with an optional AI-generated plain-language description per cell.

---

## 2. Installation

You need Python with napari already installed. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/CTichy/napari-skin-remover.git
```

All dependencies (PyTorch, MONAI, scikit-image, etc.) are installed automatically.

> **Mac with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):** The plugin automatically uses your GPU via Metal (MPS). No extra steps needed.

> **Windows / Linux with NVIDIA GPU:** CUDA is detected and used automatically. For the fastest statistics (GPU batch regionprops), `cupy-cuda12x` and `cucim` must be installed separately — see Section 13 for details.

> **No GPU:** Works on CPU too, just slower (~30–60 minutes per stack for inference).

---

## 3. Getting the model file

The AI model (~220 MB) is **not included in the plugin** and must be downloaded separately.

**Download:**

```
https://cloud.technikum-wien.at/s/kYQ4qq3Jsn4xEyY
```

Save the file `best_model_fullstack.pth` anywhere on your computer that is easy to find, for example:

```
Documents/
└── brain-peel-model/
    └── best_model_fullstack.pth
```

You will point the plugin to this file the first time you use it. **The plugin remembers the path** — you only need to do this once per installation.

---

## 4. Opening the plugin in napari

1. Open a terminal and type `napari` to launch it.
2. In the napari menu bar, click **Plugins**.
3. Click **MONAI Skin-Remover**.
4. A panel appears on the right side with two tabs: **Skin Remover** and **Create Labels**.

---

## 5. Tab 1 — Skin Remover

### Open TIF / IMS file

Click this button to open your confocal stack (`.tif`, `.tiff`, or `.ims` format).

- All channels in the file are loaded as separate napari layers, each coloured differently:
  - Channel 0 → gray
  - Channel 1 → green
  - Channel 2 → magenta
  - Channel 3 → cyan
- Voxel size (physical scale in µm) is read automatically from the file metadata and applied to all layers.
- The folder and filename are remembered for automatic output file naming (see Section 7).

> **Important:** After loading, **click on the channel you want to process** in the Layers panel on the left. The plugin always runs on whichever image layer is currently selected (highlighted). For microglia, this is usually the green channel (ch1).

---

### Model (.pth) — Browse button `[...]`

Shows the path to the AI model file. If it says "— no model selected —":

1. Click the `[...]` button.
2. Navigate to where you saved the model file.
3. Select `best_model_fullstack.pth` and click Open.

The path is saved automatically to `~/.config/napari-skin-remover/config.json`. Next time you open the plugin, the model is already loaded.

---

### Input info display

Below the model path, the plugin shows:

- The name and shape of the currently selected layer (e.g. `"NT54_ch1"  (300, 1024, 1024)  uint16`)
- The voxel dimensions: `Z=1.0000  Y=0.1740  X=0.1740 µm`
- The anisotropy ratio and the source of the scale information (from file metadata, from the layer scale, or default 1,1,1)

This is read-only — it updates automatically when you click a different layer.

---

### MONAI Threshold

**Range:** 0.01 to 0.99 — **Default: 0.30**

The AI model outputs a probability map (0 = definitely not brain, 1 = definitely brain). This slider sets the cutoff: voxels above the threshold are classified as brain.

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.20 | More generous — includes uncertain areas; may keep some skin |
| **0.30** | **Recommended — good for zebrafish at 4 dpf** |
| 0.50 | Stricter — may cut into brain edges |

> Post-processing (largest connected component + hole filling) cleans up most artefacts regardless of threshold. Keep it at 0.30 unless results look obviously wrong.

---

### Erosion (vox)

**Range:** 0 to 15 voxels — **Default: 0**

After the brain mask is computed, this many voxels are stripped inward from the mask edge before applying it to `brain_only`. This removes a thin skin rim.

- **0:** No erosion — use the mask exactly as computed.
- **2–3:** Typical for zebrafish — removes a ~0.3–0.5 µm rim in XY or 2–3 µm in Z.

> The `brain_mask.tif` saved to disk is **always the un-eroded mask**. Erosion only affects `brain_only.tif`.

---

### Background (brain mode)

Four radio buttons controlling how background signal is handled after inference.

The background level is estimated automatically using the **mode** (most common intensity) of pixels inside the brain, computed from the result of inference. The mode represents the baseline scanner noise because background pixels vastly outnumber bright cell pixels.

#### Off

No background processing. `brain_only` = original volume × brain mask. Everything outside the brain is zeroed; everything inside is the original signal unchanged.

#### 1 — Remove background outside brain (inference)

Removes background-level pixels only in the region **outside** the brain boundary. The brain interior is fully protected — nothing inside changes. Useful for cleaning up outer tissue while leaving the brain completely untouched.

- Requires BG Threshold (see below).

#### 2 — Remove background globally (full stack) ⭐ Recommended before labelling

Removes all pixels across the **entire stack** (including inside the brain) whose intensity falls at or below the background threshold.

**Result:** Only the actual signal (bright microglia, stained cells) survives. Background becomes zero everywhere, leaving clean isolated blobs with empty space between them — exactly what the Create Labels algorithm needs.

**Use this option before creating labels.**

The saved filename gets the suffix `_NoBG` (e.g. `NT54_ch1_brain_only_NoBG.tif`).

#### 3 — Fill removed with random background

After skin removal, the region outside the brain is filled with **random noise** sampled from the actual background pixel distribution. The result looks like the original stack but with skin replaced by natural scanner noise — no hard black boundary at the brain edge.

- Uses Gaussian-filtered corner pixels as the noise pool (±2σ outlier removal) so the noise matches the real scanner texture.
- BG Threshold is not used in this mode.

The saved filename gets the suffix `_RndFill` (e.g. `NT54_ch1_brain_only_RndFill.tif`).

---

### BG Threshold

**Range:** 0.00 to 2.00 — **Default: 0.50**

*(Only active for background modes 1 and 2)*

Fine-tunes the background removal threshold:

```
threshold = background_mode_value + BG_Threshold_offset
pixels ≤ threshold → removed (treated as background)
pixels  > threshold → kept (treated as signal)
```

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.00 | Threshold = exactly the mode — removes only confirmed background |
| **0.50** | **Default — removes background + a small margin above the mode** |
| 0.60 | Recommended for microglia labelling — clean separation between cells |
| 1.00+ | Aggressive — may remove dim signal from thin cell protrusions |

> For microglia labelling, **0.60** typically produces the cleanest isolated blobs with good gaps between cells. If microglia are losing thin protrusions, lower the value.

---

### Save checkboxes

- **Save brain\_only.tif** (checked by default) — saves the brain-only volume with background removed
- **Save brain\_mask.tif** (checked by default) — saves the binary mask as 0/255 uint8

Both files are saved in the output folder (see Section 7). The `brain_only` filename includes a background-mode suffix:

| Mode | Suffix | Example filename |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| Off | (none) | `NT54_ch1_brain_only.tif` |
| 1 — Exterior Removed | `_ExtRm` | `NT54_ch1_brain_only_ExtRm.tif` |
| 2 — No Background | `_NoBG` | `NT54_ch1_brain_only_NoBG.tif` |
| 3 — Random Fill | `_RndFill` | `NT54_ch1_brain_only_RndFill.tif` |

---

### Run Skin-Remover

Click to start processing. The button is greyed out while running; the status bar shows progress.

When complete, two new layers appear in napari:

- `*_brain_mask` — binary mask in cyan, semi-transparent
- `*_brain_only[suffix]` — the cleaned volume

Processing time:
- NVIDIA GPU: ~30 seconds
- Apple Silicon (MPS): ~5–10 minutes
- CPU only: ~30–60 minutes

---

## 6. Tab 2 — Create Labels

> Before using this tab, run Tab 1 with **Option 2 — Remove background globally**. Then click the resulting `brain_only` layer in the Layers panel to select it.

---

### Smooth σ XY

**Range:** 0.0 to 5.0 — **Default: 1.0** — **Recommended: 1.5**

Controls the softness of blob contours **within each 2D slice** (the XY plane).

Gaussian smoothing is applied before thresholding each slice. This rounds jagged pixel edges and fills tiny holes within the same cross-section.

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.0 | No smoothing — raw pixel edges |
| **1.5** | **Recommended — solid, rounded blobs with preserved shape** |
| 3.0+ | Heavy — risk of merging nearby cells within the same slice |

> Do not confuse with Smooth σ Z. They serve completely different purposes.

---

### Smooth σ Z

**Range:** 0.0 to 5.0 — **Default: 0.5** — **Recommended: 3.0**

Controls **cross-slice connectivity** — how easily the algorithm links blobs in neighbouring Z slices into a single 3D object.

A microglia that disappears for 1–2 slices (due to low signal or a thin neck) and reappears will be correctly merged into one 3D object when σ Z is high enough.

> **Why σ Z = 3.0 while σ XY = 1.5?**
>
> Zebrafish confocal stacks are highly anisotropic: each Z slice is ~1 µm thick while each XY pixel is ~0.17 µm. So σ Z = 3.0 spans ~3 µm physically, while σ XY = 1.5 spans only ~0.26 µm.
>
> A microglia is typically 10–20 µm in diameter. Two microglia need to be closer than ~3 µm in Z for σ Z = 3.0 to risk merging them — which is uncommon in practice. This has been validated safe for zebrafish 4dpf microglia.

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.0 | No cross-slice smoothing — each slice fully independent |
| 0.5 | Minimal — only adjacent slices with strong overlap connected |
| **3.0** | **Recommended for zebrafish — bridges 1–3 slice gaps** |
| 5.0+ | Very aggressive — may link cells at different Z depths |

---

### Min overlap (%)

**Range:** 1 to 100 — **Default: 10%**

Two blobs in adjacent slices are recognised as the **same 3D cell** only if they share at least this fraction of the smaller blob's area:

```
overlap_ratio = shared_pixel_count / area_of_smaller_blob
if overlap_ratio ≥ min_overlap% → same object (linked)
```

- **Lower (5%):** Permissive — small touching fragments are linked.
- **Higher (30%):** Strict — only well-aligned blobs linked; isolated particles stay separate.
- **Start at 10%** and increase if too many fragments are joined, or decrease if cells are being cut across slices.

---

### Min volume (vox)

**Range:** 5000 to 10000 — **Default: 7500**

After all 2D blobs are linked into 3D objects, any object smaller than this voxel count is deleted as noise.

| Value | When to use |
|-------|-------------|
| 5000 | Keep smaller objects — may include noise |
| **7500** | **Default — validated for adult zebrafish microglia** |
| 10000 | Keep only large objects — use if many small debris remain |

> Zebrafish microglia at 4dpf typically occupy 15,000–50,000 voxels at standard resolution.

---

### Create Labels

Click to run the 3D labelling algorithm. Processing runs in a background thread — the button is disabled until complete.

When done, a `*_labels` layer appears in napari with each detected cell shown in a different colour. The console prints how many labels were found.

---

### Sort by / Reverse order / Resort Labels

After creating (or loading) labels, you can renumber them by a criterion of your choice.

**Sort by** dropdown:

| Option | Meaning | Default order |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| Size | Number of voxels | Largest = label 1 |
| Centroid Z | Z coordinate of centre | Smallest Z = label 1 |
| Centroid Y | Y coordinate of centre | Smallest Y = label 1 |
| Centroid X | X coordinate of centre | Smallest X = label 1 |

**Reverse order** checkbox — inverts the ordering (e.g. smallest = label 1 for Size).

Click **Resort Labels** to apply. The active Labels layer is renumbered 1…N in the chosen order, in place. This is useful for consistent numbering across samples or for matching cells to a reference atlas.

---

### Split Label

Splits a single merged label (a blob where two or more cells are stuck together) into separate parts using a 3D watershed algorithm.

The watershed approach finds the **thinnest neck** connecting two large volumes and cuts there — it does not use a simple distance threshold or Euclidean splitting.

#### Target label

The label number of the blob you want to split. You can type it directly, or:

1. In the napari viewer, hover over the blob and read the label number shown in the status bar.
2. Click the blob to select it in the Labels layer.
3. Click **Use selected** — the label number is filled in automatically.

#### Use selected

Reads the currently selected label from the active napari Labels layer and fills it into the Target label spinner. Click the blob in napari first, then click this button.

#### Split into N parts

**Range:** 2 to 10 — **Default: 2**

How many separate pieces the blob should be divided into. The algorithm searches for the N largest sub-volumes (separated at their thinnest necks) and cuts between them.

> If the blob genuinely has only one major volume (no neck), splitting may fail or produce uneven results. Increase Smooth σ or use a lower Min distance if that happens.

#### Smooth σ (Split)

**Range:** 0.0 to 3.0 — **Default: 1.0**

Gaussian smoothing applied to the distance transform before searching for peaks. Higher values smooth out the distance map, making the algorithm more robust to surface noise but less sensitive to subtle necks.

- **0.5–1.0:** Suitable for most cases.
- **1.5–2.0:** Use if the split point jumps around — smoother distance field = more stable result.
- **0.0:** No smoothing — very sensitive to surface texture.

#### Min distance

**Range:** 1 to 30 voxels — **Default: 5**

Minimum voxel distance required between accepted seed peaks. If two candidate peaks are closer than this, only the stronger one is kept.

- **Too high:** The two centres of a closely-packed double-blob may be rejected as "too close" → fewer than N peaks found → error.
- **Too low:** Surface noise peaks may be accepted as separate centres → wrong split point.
- **5 voxels** works well for microglia-sized cells.

#### Split Label (button)

Click to run. The original blob is replaced in-place:

- The original label number is kept for the **first** part (the largest sub-volume).
- New label numbers (`max_existing + 1`, `max_existing + 2`, …) are assigned to the remaining parts.

The cut is **interface-only**: exactly the voxels at the boundary between parts are removed, creating a 1-voxel gap. The outer surface of each part is not touched — thin protrusions are preserved.

If the algorithm cannot find N distinct sub-volumes, an error message is shown. Try reducing Smooth σ or Min distance.

---

### Save Labels

Opens a file-save dialog pre-filled with the output folder (see Section 7) and the current layer name as the filename. Choose a location and filename, then click Save.

Labels are saved as `int32` TIFF. Each voxel value = label number (0 = background).

> **Save Labels is separate from Create Labels by design.** This lets you edit labels in napari (split, delete, merge) before saving the final result.

> After saving labels, switch to **Tab 3 — Statistics** to compute measurements for each cell.

---

## 7. Tab 3 — Statistics

This tab computes a comprehensive set of morphological, spatial, intensity, and brain-region measurements for every label and saves them to a CSV file. It is intentionally separate from Tab 2 so there is room to configure all options comfortably before clicking Generate.

> Make sure a Labels layer is selected in napari before using this tab.

---

### Description backend

Selects the engine used to generate the plain-language `description` column in the CSV.

| Option | Internet | Cost | Notes |
|--------|----------|------|-------|
| **Rule-based (offline)** | No | Free | Always available; template-based sentences |
| **Ollama (local, free)** | No | Free | Runs a local LLM on your machine |
| **OpenAI API (paid)** | Yes | Pay-per-token | GPT-4o-mini recommended for low cost |
| **Claude API (paid)** | Yes | Pay-per-token | claude-haiku-4-5 recommended for low cost |

See Section 10 for detailed setup instructions for each backend.

---

### Ollama sub-panel (shown when Ollama is selected)

- **Endpoint:** URL where Ollama is running. Default: `http://localhost:11434`. Change this if Ollama runs on a different machine or port.
- **Model:** The Ollama model name to use (e.g. `llama3`, `mistral`, `phi3`). Must be pulled first (`ollama pull llama3`).

---

### API sub-panel (shown for OpenAI or Claude)

- **API Key:** Your secret API key. Shown as dots (password field). **Not saved to disk** — you must re-enter it each session.
- **Model:** The model identifier (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini` for OpenAI, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` for Claude).
- **Base URL:** Optional. Leave blank unless you use an OpenAI-compatible proxy or self-hosted endpoint.

---

### Intensity statistics (optional)

**Image layer** dropdown — select an Image layer from your napari session (or leave as "None" to skip).

When an image layer is selected, three additional columns are computed per label using the raw intensity values inside each cell's mask:

- `mean_intensity` — average pixel intensity inside the label
- `integrated_intensity` — total sum of all pixel values (proportional to total fluorescent material)
- `intensity_cv` — coefficient of variation (std / mean) — a measure of how uniform the signal is; 0 = perfectly uniform, high values = heterogeneous staining

> Select the microglia channel (usually the green channel, ch1) for biologically meaningful results.

---

### Brain regions (optional)

Assigns each cell to a named anatomical brain region and computes its distance to the nearest region boundary.

**Boundary lines** dropdown — select a Shapes layer containing one or more `line` shapes, or leave as "None" to skip.

**Region names** text field — enter the region names separated by commas, listed anterior to posterior. For N boundary lines, provide exactly N+1 names.

Example: If you draw one line separating the optic tectum from the hindbrain, enter:
```
Optic tectum, Hindbrain
```

**How to draw region boundaries:**

1. In the napari toolbar, click **New shapes layer** (or add via Layers → Add shapes layer).
2. Select the **line** tool in the toolbar.
3. Draw a line across the brain at the anatomical boundary — typically visible as a change in cell density. Draw left-to-right (anterior first).
4. For multiple regions, draw one line per boundary.
5. Select the Shapes layer in the **Boundary lines** dropdown and type your region names.

The boundary lines are sorted automatically by their midpoint X-coordinate (left = anterior). Each cell centroid is tested against each boundary in order to determine which region it falls in.

Two additional columns are added to the CSV:

- `brain_region` — name of the region this cell belongs to
- `region_boundary_dist_um` — distance in µm to the nearest region boundary line

---

### Generate Statistics (button)

Click to compute. Runs in a background thread. When complete:

- A CSV file is saved to the output folder (see Section 8), named `{source_file_stem}_statistics.csv`.
- The status line shows how many labels were processed.

The CSV contains one row per label with up to 45 columns depending on which optional features are enabled. See Section 9 for a full description of every column.


---

## 8. Output files and folder structure

All files saved by the plugin go into a dedicated folder named after your original input file:

```
/path/to/your/data/
├── NT54_ch1.ims                        ← original input file
└── NT54_ch1/                           ← output folder (created automatically)
    ├── NT54_ch1_brain_mask.tif         ← binary brain mask (0/255, uint8)
    ├── NT54_ch1_brain_only_NoBG.tif    ← brain only, background removed globally
    ├── NT54_ch1_labels.tif             ← cell labels (int32)
    └── NT54_ch1_statistics.csv         ← per-label statistics
```

The folder is created the first time a file is saved. If no input file has been opened (e.g. you loaded a layer directly in napari), files are saved in the current working directory.

**Brain-only suffixes** depending on background mode:

| Mode | Suffix |
|------|--------|
| Off | *(none)* |
| 1 — Exterior Removed | `_ExtRm` |
| 2 — No Background | `_NoBG` |
| 3 — Random Fill | `_RndFill` |

---

## 9. Statistics CSV — all columns explained

The CSV produced by Generate Statistics has one row per label, with up to 45 columns. The first 39 are always present; the remaining columns appear only when the corresponding optional feature is enabled.

---

### Identification

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `label` | integer | Label number matching the napari Labels layer (1, 2, 3, …) |

---

### Volume

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `volume_vox` | integer | Number of voxels belonging to this label |
| `volume_um3` | float (µm³) | Physical volume in cubic micrometres. Computed as `volume_vox × Z_size × Y_size × X_size`. A typical zebrafish microglia is 1,000–10,000 µm³. |

---

### Position (centroid)

The centroid is the 3D centre of mass of the label — the average position of all its voxels.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `centroid_z_vox` | float | Z position in voxel units |
| `centroid_y_vox` | float | Y position in voxel units |
| `centroid_x_vox` | float | X position in voxel units |
| `centroid_z_um` | float (µm) | Z position in micrometres |
| `centroid_y_um` | float (µm) | Y position in micrometres |
| `centroid_x_um` | float (µm) | X position in micrometres |

---

### Bounding box

The smallest rectangular box (aligned with the axes) that completely contains the label.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `bbox_dz_um` | float (µm) | Height of the bounding box in Z (depth of the cell in the axial direction) |
| `bbox_dy_um` | float (µm) | Height of the bounding box in Y |
| `bbox_dx_um` | float (µm) | Width of the bounding box in X |

---

### Size and shape

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `eq_diam_um` | float (µm) | **Equivalent sphere diameter** — the diameter of a perfect sphere with the same volume as this label. Formula: `(6V/π)^(1/3)`. Useful as a single "size" number regardless of shape. |
| `axis1_um` | float (µm) | **Longest principal axis** — the maximum extent of the label along its longest geometric direction. Derived from the inertia tensor eigenvectors. |
| `axis2_um` | float (µm) | **Middle principal axis** — approximated as the average of axis1 and axis3. |
| `axis3_um` | float (µm) | **Shortest principal axis** — the minimum extent perpendicular to the longest axis. |
| `elongation` | float | **Elongation ratio** = `axis1 / axis3`. A perfect sphere = 1.0. A cigar-shaped cell = 3.0 or more. The higher the number, the more stretched out the cell is. |
| `principal_axis_dir` | string | The anatomical direction of the longest axis: `"Z"` (axial), `"Y"` (coronal), or `"X"` (sagittal). Tells you which direction the cell is elongated in. |

---

### Surface and compactness

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `solidity` | float (0–1) | **Solidity** = `volume / convex_hull_volume`. The convex hull is the smallest convex shape enclosing the label (like shrink-wrap). A solid, convex cell = 1.0. A lobulated or branchy cell with lots of indentations < 1.0. Typical range for microglia: 0.5–0.9. |
| `extent` | float (0–1) | **Extent** = `volume / bounding_box_volume`. How much of the bounding box is actually filled. A cube = 1.0. A sphere ≈ 0.52. Highly branched cells = much lower. |
| `surface_area_um2` | float (µm²) | **Surface area** in square micrometres, computed using marching cubes — a 3D mesh is generated from the label boundary and the triangle areas summed. A cell with long thin branches has a much larger surface area than a smooth sphere of the same volume. |
| `sphericity` | float (0–1) | **Sphericity** = `π^(1/3) × (6V)^(2/3) / A` where V = volume and A = surface area. A perfect sphere = 1.0. Anything less than 1.0 is less spherical. Microglia: typically 0.3–0.8 depending on branch complexity. |
| `surface_to_volume_ratio` | float (µm⁻¹) | **Surface-to-volume ratio** = surface_area / volume. Higher values indicate more complex, surface-rich morphology relative to cell size. Branches and protrusions increase this dramatically. |

---

### Skeleton (branching structure)

These columns require the `skan` package. If `skan` is not installed, they will be 0.

The algorithm skeletonizes the label (reduces it to a 1-voxel-wide skeleton) and analyses the resulting graph of branches.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `n_branches` | integer | Number of skeleton branches. A sphere = 1 branch. A microglia with 4 protrusions = roughly 4–8 branches depending on how they connect. |
| `n_endpoints` | integer | Number of free-end branch tips (branches that don't loop back). Corresponds roughly to the number of protrusion tips. |
| `mean_branch_len_um` | float (µm) | Average path length of all skeleton branches in micrometres. |
| `max_branch_len_um` | float (µm) | Length of the longest individual branch — an indicator of maximum protrusion reach. |
| `branch_tortuosity` | float (≥1) | Average ratio of path length to straight-line distance per branch. A value of 1.0 = perfectly straight branches. Higher values = winding, curved protrusions. |
| `branch_density` | float (per 10⁶ µm³) | Number of branches per million cubic micrometres of cell volume. Allows fair comparison between cells of different sizes. |
| `endpoint_density` | float (per 10⁶ µm³) | Number of branch tips per million cubic micrometres. A proxy for protrusion count normalised by cell volume. |
| `process_complexity` | float | Combined measure of branching complexity: `n_branches × mean_branch_len / eq_diam`. High values = many long branches relative to cell diameter. |

---

### Morphotype classification

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `morphotype` | string | Automatic shape classification based on elongation, sphericity, solidity, branch count, and surface-to-volume ratio. Categories: **Rod-shaped** (elongated, few branches), **Amoeboid** (round, compact, few branches), **Ramified** (many long branches, low sphericity), **Intermediate-ramified** (moderate branching), **Intermediate** (doesn't fit the above). |

---

### Spatial relationships

These columns use all cell centroids together to compute neighbourhood statistics.

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `nearest_neighbor_dist_um` | float (µm) | Distance to the closest other cell centroid. Small values = cells are tightly packed; large values = isolated cells. |
| `nearest_neighbor_ratio` | float | **Clark-Evans 3D index** for this cell: the ratio of its nearest-neighbour distance to the expected distance if cells were randomly distributed at the same density. Values < 1 = clustering; > 1 = regularity/dispersion. |
| `local_density_100um` | float (cells/10⁶ µm³) | Number of other cells within a 100 µm radius sphere, normalised by sphere volume. A measure of local neighbourhood crowding. |
| `depth_normalized` | float (0–1) | Z position normalised to the full depth range of all cells: 0 = shallowest cell, 1 = deepest. Useful for comparing dorsal vs. ventral distribution across samples. |

---

### Intensity statistics *(optional — requires Image layer selection)*

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `mean_intensity` | float | Mean pixel intensity inside the label mask. Reflects overall fluorescence brightness of the cell. |
| `integrated_intensity` | float | Sum of all pixel values inside the label (mean × voxel count). Proportional to total fluorescent material in the cell regardless of size. |
| `intensity_cv` | float (0–∞) | Coefficient of variation of pixel intensities = std / mean. 0 = perfectly uniform. High values = heterogeneous staining, possibly indicating internal structure or imaging artefacts. |

---

### Brain region assignment *(optional — requires Shapes layer with boundary lines)*

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `brain_region` | string | Name of the anatomical region this cell belongs to (as defined by the boundary lines and region names you provided). |
| `region_boundary_dist_um` | float (µm) | Distance from this cell's centroid to the nearest region boundary line, in micrometres. Cells near boundaries may have mixed characteristics. |

---

### Description

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `description` | string | A plain-language sentence summarising the cell's shape, generated by the selected description backend. Example (rule-based): *"Label 3: Elongated along Y-axis (2.8:1), volume 4,521 µm³, centroid Z=87.3 Y=142.1 X=203.5 µm. Lobulated/irregular surface, sphericity 0.41, solidity 0.72. Morphotype: Intermediate-ramified. 6 branches, 4 endpoints (mean 8.3 µm), tortuosity 1.4."* |

---

## 10. Setting up description backends

### Rule-based (offline) — no setup needed

The default. Descriptions are generated using built-in templates based on the numeric values. No internet connection, no API key, no external software. Always available.

---

### Ollama (local, free)

Ollama runs a large language model locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers, and there is no ongoing cost after the initial download.

**Step 1 — Install Ollama**

Go to [https://ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and download the installer for your operating system. Run it.

- On Linux: `curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh`
- On Mac: Download the `.dmg` and drag to Applications.
- On Windows: Download the `.exe` installer.

**Step 2 — Download a model**

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
ollama pull llama3
```

This downloads the Llama 3 model (~4.7 GB). You only need to do this once. Other models you can use:

```bash
ollama pull mistral      # ~4 GB, fast
ollama pull phi3         # ~2 GB, smaller and faster
ollama pull llama3:70b   # ~40 GB, highest quality — needs 64 GB+ RAM
```

**Step 3 — Verify Ollama is running**

Ollama starts automatically in the background after installation. You can confirm it is running:

```bash
ollama list   # should show your downloaded models
```

**Step 4 — Configure in the plugin**

In **Tab 3 — Statistics**:

1. Select **Ollama (local, free)** from the Description dropdown.
2. **Endpoint:** leave as `http://localhost:11434` (default). Only change this if Ollama runs on a different machine on your network.
3. **Model:** type the model name you downloaded, e.g. `llama3`.
4. Click **Generate Statistics**.

> If you get an `[Ollama error: ...]` in the CSV description column, check that Ollama is running (`ollama list`) and that the model name matches exactly what you downloaded.

---

### OpenAI API (paid)

OpenAI's GPT models run on OpenAI's servers. You pay per token processed. For statistics descriptions (short prompts, short responses), the cost is very low — roughly $0.001–0.01 per 100 cells with `gpt-4o-mini`.

**Step 1 — Create an OpenAI account**

Go to [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com) and sign up. You will need to provide a credit card for billing.

**Step 2 — Generate an API key**

1. Log in to [https://platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com).
2. Click your profile icon (top right) → **API keys**.
3. Click **+ Create new secret key**.
4. Give it a name (e.g. "napari-skin-remover").
5. Copy the key immediately — it starts with `sk-` and you can only see it once.

**Step 3 — Configure in the plugin**

In **Tab 3 — Statistics**:

1. Select **OpenAI API (paid)** from the Description dropdown.
2. **API Key:** paste your `sk-...` key. It is stored only in memory — not saved to disk.
3. **Model:** `gpt-4o-mini` (recommended — low cost, good quality). Other options:
   - `gpt-4o` — highest quality, higher cost
   - `gpt-3.5-turbo` — fastest, cheapest, lower quality
4. **Base URL:** leave blank unless you use an OpenAI-compatible proxy.
5. Click **Generate Statistics**.

> The API key is **not saved to disk** for security. You must paste it again each time you open napari.

---

### Claude API (paid)

Anthropic's Claude models. Similar pricing model to OpenAI. Claude Haiku is very fast and inexpensive.

**Step 1 — Create an Anthropic account**

Go to [https://console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com) and sign up with a credit card.

**Step 2 — Generate an API key**

1. Log in to [https://console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. Click **API Keys** in the left sidebar.
3. Click **+ Create Key**.
4. Give it a name and copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`).

**Step 3 — Configure in the plugin**

In **Tab 3 — Statistics**:

1. Select **Claude API (paid)** from the Description dropdown.
2. **API Key:** paste your `sk-ant-...` key.
3. **Model:** `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` (recommended — fast and cheap). Other options:
   - `claude-sonnet-4-6` — higher quality, moderate cost
   - `claude-opus-4-6` — highest quality, highest cost
4. **Base URL:** leave blank (not used for Claude).
5. Click **Generate Statistics**.

---

## 11. Full workflow: from raw stack to labelled cells

### Step 1 — Open your file

1. Open the plugin (Plugins → MONAI Skin-Remover) in napari.
2. Click **Open TIF / IMS file** and select your confocal stack.
3. All channels appear as layers.
4. **Click the microglia channel** (usually ch1, green) in the Layers panel.

---

### Step 2 — Run skin removal

Set these values in Tab 1:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| MONAI Threshold | 0.30 (default) |
| Erosion | 0 (default) |
| Background | **Option 2 — Remove globally** |
| BG Threshold | **0.60** |

Click **Run Skin-Remover** and wait.

**What you should see:** A `brain_only` layer where microglia appear as bright isolated blobs on a black background, with clear space between cells.

**If blobs look hollow or have large halos:** Lower BG Threshold (e.g. 0.40).

**If too much dim signal remains between cells:** Raise BG Threshold (e.g. 0.80).

---

### Step 3 — Create labels

1. **Click the `brain_only_NoBG` layer** in the Layers panel.
2. Switch to the **Create Labels** tab.
3. Set these values:

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Smooth σ XY | **1.5** |
| Smooth σ Z | **3.0** |
| Min overlap | 10% (default) |
| Min volume | 7500 (default) |

4. Click **Create Labels**.

**What you should see:** A labels layer where each cell is a different colour. The console prints how many were found.

**Tuning:**
- Too many tiny fragments → increase Min volume or increase both σ values
- Two cells merged together → try Split Label (see below)
- Cells cut across slices → decrease Min overlap or increase σ Z

---

### Step 4 — Review and edit labels in napari

- Toggle the labels layer on/off to compare with the original
- Hover over cells to see their label number
- Zoom through Z slices to verify cells are correctly separated

---

### Step 5 — Split merged cells (if needed)

If two cells were labelled as one because they touch:

1. Hover over the merged blob and note its label number (shown in the napari status bar at the bottom).
2. In Tab 2, under **Split Label**:
   - **Target label:** enter the label number (or click the blob and click **Use selected**).
   - **Split into:** 2 (or however many cells are merged).
   - **Smooth σ:** 1.0 (default).
   - **Min distance:** 5 (default).
3. Click **Split Label**.
4. The two (or more) cells are separated at their thinnest connection point.

---

### Step 6 — Sort labels (optional)

Click **Resort Labels** to renumber cells by size or position. This is helpful for consistent reporting:

- By **Size** (largest = label 1) — most common
- By **Centroid Z/Y/X** — for atlas alignment

---

### Step 7 — Save labels

Click **Save Labels**. A file dialog opens pre-filled with the output folder. Accept or change the name and click Save.

---

### Step 8 — Generate statistics

1. Click the **Statistics** tab (Tab 3).
2. Make sure the Labels layer is selected in napari.
3. Choose your description backend.
4. *(Optional)* Select a fluorescence channel under **Intensity statistics** to add mean/integrated/CV columns.
5. *(Optional)* Draw region boundary lines in a Shapes layer, then select it under **Brain regions** and enter the region names.
6. Click **Generate Statistics**.
7. The CSV is saved automatically to the output folder.

---

## 12. Reinstalling after an update

```bash
pip uninstall napari-skin-remover -y
pip install git+https://github.com/CTichy/napari-skin-remover.git
```

Then **fully close and reopen napari**. If napari is running when you reinstall, it uses the old version until restarted.

> **Your model path and settings are preserved** across reinstalls. The config is stored in `~/.config/napari-skin-remover/config.json`.

---

## 13. Troubleshooting

### The plugin does not appear in Plugins menu

- Make sure napari is fully closed and reopened after installation.
- Verify installation: `pip show napari-skin-remover`

---

### "No model selected" after reinstalling

- Click `[...]` and browse to your `.pth` file.
- Config path: `~/.config/napari-skin-remover/config.json`

---

### Processing runs on CPU (very slow)

**NVIDIA GPU:** Check that PyTorch sees CUDA:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

Should print `True`. If `False`, reinstall PyTorch with CUDA support from [https://pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org).

**Apple Silicon:** Check MPS:

```bash
python -c "import torch; print(torch.backends.mps.is_available())"
```

Should print `True` on M1/M2/M3.

---

### Statistics are slow (CPU only, no GPU batch)

Install CuPy and cuCIM for GPU-accelerated regionprops:

```bash
pip install cupy-cuda12x cucim
```

Replace `cuda12x` with your actual CUDA version if different (e.g. `cuda11x` for CUDA 11). After installing, reopen napari — the console will print `regionprops: cuCIM GPU` when statistics are computed.

---

### `brain_only` layer looks mostly empty (all black)

BG Threshold is too high — lower it (e.g. from 0.60 to 0.30).

---

### Create Labels finds 0 or too few objects

- Lower **Min volume** (try 5000).
- Increase **σ XY** and **σ Z** slightly.
- Make sure you selected the `brain_only` layer (not the raw channel) before clicking Create Labels.

---

### Create Labels finds hundreds of tiny fragments

- Increase **Min volume** to 10000.
- Ensure Option 2 with sufficient BG Threshold was used — the brain_only layer must have clean gaps between cells.

---

### Two cells appear as one label (merged)

- Use **Split Label** (Section 6 above) to separate them at the thinnest neck.
- Or decrease σ XY and rerun Create Labels.

---

### Split Label error: "Only N sub-volume(s) found"

The blob doesn't have a clear separation into the requested number of parts.

- Reduce **Smooth σ** (the distance field is over-smoothed and the saddle disappears).
- Reduce **Min distance** (the two centres are being rejected as too close).
- Check the blob is genuinely two distinct cells — zoom in and inspect it slice by slice.

---

### Ollama description shows `[Ollama error: ...]`

- Verify Ollama is running: open a terminal and run `ollama list`.
- If not running, start it: `ollama serve`
- Check the model name matches exactly: `ollama list` shows available models.
- Default endpoint `http://localhost:11434` — change only if Ollama is on a different machine.

---

### OpenAI/Claude API returns an error

- The API key must be pasted fresh each session — it is not saved to disk.
- Check your account has billing set up and enough credit.
- The model name must match exactly (e.g. `gpt-4o-mini`, `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`).
